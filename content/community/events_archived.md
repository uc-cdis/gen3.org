  title: Gen3 Community Events
  detail: About every other month, there is a virtual Gen3 Forum for the community of Gen3 developers, operators, sponsors and users of Gen3 data platforms. These events aim to share information about how to set up new Gen3 instances, build a community that can help each other, and create clear paths for support from the Gen3 core development team.

- Title: Testing code with the new Gen3 testing framework
  Date: November 6, 3:30-5:00 pm CDT; November 7, 2024, 8:30-10:00 am AEDT
  Description: Gen3 values code contributions from our open-source community. However, the continuous integration testing available within our GitHub repositories has generally not been available to contributors external to CTDS.  This has made it difficult for contributors to assess their code changes and get them merged into the Gen3 codebase.  We will discuss in the forum the new Gen3 testing framework, which makes these tests available to anyone.  We will also discuss how contributors can create and contribute their own tests as part of their pull requests.  Speakers will include Peter Vassilatos, Director of Engineering, and Hara Juvvala, Principal Software Engineer in Test, both from the Center for Translational Data Science at the University of Chicago.

- Title: GA4GH standards in Gen3
  Date: September 18, 4:30-5:30 pm CDT; September 19, 2024, 7:30-8:30am AEST
  Description: GA4GH is an international standards setting body for Genomics and Health. Gen3 aims to follow GA4GH standards whenever possible in order to improve our interoperability with other systems and to simplify the use of a Gen3 Data Commons. Join us at our next community forum where we will provide an overview of our GA4GH compliant services and share plans for the future. Speakers will include Robert Grossman and Michael Lukowski from the University of Chicago, Center for Translational Data Science and Kyle Ellrott from the Oregon Health and Science University.

- Title: Data submission - Perspectives and solutions from different Gen3 systems
  Date: July 10, 3:30-5:00 pm CDT; July 11, 2024, 6:30-8:00am am AEST
  Description: Gen3 data submission can be complex and will vary from project to project.  The specifics will depend on the data model, data type, use of graph-model and/or metadata service, centrally managed vs user driven, and other project-specific requirements.  At this event we will hear from a range of Gen3 operators on how their projects approach the topic of data submission and how they have managed this process.

- Title: How to Build a Data Mesh Using Gen3
  Date: May 1, 2023, 3:30-5:00 pm CST; May 2, 2023, 6:30-8:00 am AEST
  Description:  "Data meshes or ecosystems consist of an interconnected network of data resources (e.g. data commons, repositories, or knowledgebases) that are integrated by utilizing a common set of software services. Each component data resource may have many of its own systems and separate governance, but they are all connected via framework or mesh services such as authentication and authorization, data indexing, and metadata services. In this Gen3 community event we'll describe the Gen3 Mesh Services, and you will hear from a few projects and applications that are utilizing the Gen3 mesh functionality. As always we will leave plenty of time for questions and discussion."

  Date: March 1, 2023, 3:30-5:00 pm CST; March 2, 2023, 8:30-10:00 am AEST
  Description:  "We will take you through the current best practices for setting up and configuring your own Gen3 Data Commons in multiple clouds by using Helm Charts. Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications, which is a system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The use of Helm will greatly simplify standing up, configuring, and maintaining your own Gen3 Data Commons. This is the first of a series of community events through 2023."

  Description:  "The Gen3 Community Forum consists of those developing and operating Gen3 data commons and data meshes, those considering developing Gen3 data commons and meshes, and other stakeholders involved with the Gen3 community. The four aims of the Forum are: to share knowledge about Gen3, its architecture, and the Gen3 roadmaps and priorities; to strengthen the connection between the Gen3 core team and those developing, operating and using Gen3 platforms; to design a set of ongoing community engagement activities; and to discuss and agree on key shared development priorities between the Gen3 core team and the Gen3 community.

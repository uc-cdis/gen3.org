- Title: Integrating AI tools into Gen3
  Date: November 5, 2025 3:30-5:30 pm CST (November 6, 2025, 8:30-10:00 am AEDT)
  Description: Director of CTDS, Robert Grossman, will share with the community the roadmap for AI in Gen3.  Planned features include model inference, training, and fine tuning using data in a commons, vector store for embeddings, chat-like query interface, and federated AI in Gen3 meshes.

- Title: Understanding ETL and ETL mapping to power the Gen3 Exploration Page
  Date: September 3, 2025 4:00-5:30 pm CT (September 4, 2025, 6:30-8:00 am AEST)
  Description: The Gen3 Exploration page is where users build cohorts and identify files of interest to their research goals. ETL mapping allows you to customize how your data can be searched on this page. Different mapping strategies will produce different search options on the Exploration page. Dan Biber, of the Gen3 User Services team, will explain how to think about ETL mapping in order to create the elasticsearch indices necessary for Guppy to be able to provide your desired search capabilities in the frontend. He will demonstrate the microservice Tube, which runs ETL, and provide several examples using different use cases for how one may want the the data to be represented and searchable in the Exploration Page.

- Title: Gen3 Deployment Options
  Date: July 2, 2025 4:00-5:15 pm CT (July 3, 2025, 7:00-8:15 am AEST)
  Description: Gen3 is cloud agnostic and can be deployed on a variety of infrastructures.  Many of our talks and much of our documentation focuses on AWS, but in this session we will highlight other solutions including on-prem, local on a laptop, and other cloud providers such as GCP and Azure.  Please come with your questions for our panel of speakers.

- Title: Testing code with the new Gen3 testing framework
  Date: November 6, 3:30-5:00 pm CDT; November 7, 2024, 8:30-10:00 am AEDT
  Description: Gen3 values code contributions from our open-source community. However, the continuous integration testing available within our GitHub repositories has generally not been available to contributors external to CTDS.  This has made it difficult for contributors to assess their code changes and get them merged into the Gen3 codebase.  We will discuss in the forum the new Gen3 testing framework, which makes these tests available to anyone.  We will also discuss how contributors can create and contribute their own tests as part of their pull requests.  Speakers will include Peter Vassilatos, Director of Engineering, and Hara Juvvala, Principal Software Engineer in Test, both from the Center for Translational Data Science at the University of Chicago.

- Title: GA4GH standards in Gen3
  Date: September 18, 4:30-5:30 pm CDT; September 19, 2024, 7:30-8:30am AEST
  Description: GA4GH is an international standards setting body for Genomics and Health. Gen3 aims to follow GA4GH standards whenever possible in order to improve our interoperability with other systems and to simplify the use of a Gen3 Data Commons. Join us at our next community forum where we will provide an overview of our GA4GH compliant services and share plans for the future. Speakers will include Robert Grossman and Michael Lukowski from the University of Chicago, Center for Translational Data Science and Kyle Ellrott from the Oregon Health and Science University.

- Title: Data submission - Perspectives and solutions from different Gen3 systems
  Date: July 10, 3:30-5:00 pm CDT; July 11, 2024, 6:30-8:00am am AEST
  Description: Gen3 data submission can be complex and will vary from project to project.  The specifics will depend on the data model, data type, use of graph-model and/or metadata service, centrally managed vs user driven, and other project-specific requirements.  At this event we will hear from a range of Gen3 operators on how their projects approach the topic of data submission and how they have managed this process.

## Gen3 Community Forum Agenda

### July 10, 2024 (US)/July 11, 2024 (AU/NZ)
</br>
<p>
Gen3 data submission can be complex and will vary from project to project. The specifics will depend on the data model, data type, use of graph-model and/or metadata service, centrally managed vs user driven, and other project-specific requirements. At this event we will hear from a range of Gen3 operators on how their projects approach the topic of data submission and how they have managed this process. The event will include the following presentations and speakers:
</p>

* Data Modelling in Gen3 - Joshua Harris, Research Data Manager, Australian BioCommons
* Data submission into the Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository - Nathalie Giraudon, New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI)
* COVID-19 Data: 7 Million Records in PRC - Plamen Martinov, Open Commons Consortium
* MIDRC: Ingesting Medical Images from Multiple Contributors - Chris Meyer, Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago
* g3t: Gen3 Tracker â€“ User Driven Submissions - Liam Beckman, Oregon Health and Science University

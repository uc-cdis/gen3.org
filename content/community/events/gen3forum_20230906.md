## Gen3 Community Forum Agenda

### September 6, 2023 (US)/September 7, 2023 (AU/NZ)
</br>
<p>
 Gen3 is designed to enable secure and compliant data sharing and analysis for researchers around the world. However, security and compliance can be a complex topic and so we will focus our next event on security best practices.  The event will also include experiences from other Gen3 operators on setting up and maintaining a Gen3 Data Commons from a security perspective.  The event will include the following presentations by the following speakers:
</p>

* Robert Grossman - Professor, Director; Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago
* Clint Malson - Director of Security Operations; Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago
* Plamen Martinov - Chief Technology Officer; Open Commons Consortium
* Colin Griffin - Founder, Chief Engineer; Krumware

## Gen3 Community Forum Agenda

### March 4, 2026 (US)/March 5, 2026 (AU/NZ)
</br>
<p>
Description: Deployment and monitoring of a Gen3 system takes significant cloud expertise.  Over the past year, the Gen3 Commons Services Operations Center (CSOC) working group has been meeting to share knowledge and build new capabilities in order to simplify and improve Gen3 deployment and monitoring.  At our March community forum meeting we will share some of the work that has come out of this group's efforts. The event will include the following presentations and speakers:
</p>

* A CSOC dashboard for managing Gen3 deployment and monitoring - Jawad Qureshi, Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago
* Developing Kro as a solution for infrastructure setup and Gen3 deployment - Alan Walsh, University of Indiana
* Bootstrapping Gen3 with AWS CDK, ArgoCD, and Helm - Guerdon Mukama, Australian BioCommons
* Building and Managing Multiple Data Commons in OCC's CSOC - Stephen Dranger and Urvi Sheth, Open Commons Consortium
* Using Gen3 as a platform and running additional services such as GEARBOx - Luca Graglia, Data for the Common Good, University of Chicago

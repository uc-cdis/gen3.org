## Gen3 Community Forum Agenda

### July 2, 2025 (US)/July 3, 2025 (AU/NZ)
</br>
<p>
Gen3 is cloud agnostic and can be deployed on a variety of infrastructures.  Many of our talks and much of our documentation focuses on AWS, but in this session we will highlight other solutions including on-prem, local on a laptop, and other cloud providers such as GCP and Azure.  Please come with your questions for our panel of speakers. The event will include the following presentations and speakers:
</p>

* Update on Gen3 deployment on Openstack - Claire Rye, Nathalie Giraudon, and Carvin Chen; New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI)
* Cloud native platform engineering approaches for research and researchers - Colin Griffin, Krumware
* Deploying on-premise Gen3; constraints, plans and opportunities - National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) Australia Team
* Gen3 single node deployment - Platform Engineering Team, Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago

  title: Gen3 Support Organizations
  detail: Some commercial and not-for-profit organizations offer services to help groups set up their own Gen3 data commons or meshes.  This includes support for design, deployment, modification, and maintenance of a Gen3 system.  We have included a list of all such organization of which we are aware.  Please reach out if your organization would like to be added to the list. Inclusion of an organization on this list does not constitute an endorsement of their services.  The Gen3 source code remains completely open access and the Gen3 community is always welcome to ask questions or seek assistance on the Gen3 Community slack channel free of charge.

                <p>BioTeam is a scientific IT consulting company at the intersection of science, data, and technology. Relentlessly focused on closing the gap between what scientists want to do with dataâ€”and what they can do. Our team brings extensive experience in Gen3 AWS-based cloud deployments and EKS cluster management. We excel in microservice customization and development, allowing seamless integration of Gen3 with existing systems and enablement of new capabilities. Our expertise also extends to fitting Gen3 with novel scientific use cases, large-scale parallel dataset indexing, storage infrastructure (EBS) customization and tuning, user-interface development, and tailoring Gen3 deployments to be compliant across a diverse spectrum of network architectures and DevOps environments.

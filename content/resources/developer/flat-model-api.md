# Gen3 Flat Model

The new flat model requires new GraphQL syntax. As it maps to the data in Elasticsearch, it requires few additional keywords to use in GraphQL query.

## Querying

The flat model GraphQL for querying use two keywords: `hits`, `node` and `edges`. `hits` refer to the matched item and `edges` with `node` used to get the values from the matched item.

For example, to query `subject` and get `id`, `year_of_birth` and `vital_status` for all of them, you need to run:

```
{
  subject {
    hits {
      total
      edges {
        node {
          id
          year_of_birth
          vital_status
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Paging & Sorting

By default, flat model GraphQL returns only first 10 matches. To find out more matches, you can specify `first` and `offset` parameters for `hits`:

```
{
  subject {
    hits(last: 5, offset: 0) {
      total
      edges {
        node {
          id
          year_of_birth
          vital_status
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Changing `offset`, you can iteratively get all items.

In addition, `hits` supports sorting with the `sort` keyword. In this keys it will return first 5 **subject** with the greatest **_samples_count**. `sort` supports both `asc` and `desc` sorting.

```
{
  subject {
    hits(last: 5, offset: 0, sort: [
      {
				field: "_samples_count",
				order: desc
    	}
    ]) {
      total
      edges {
        node {
          id
          vital_status
          _samples_count
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Multiple sorting will sort by all the field. The following query will result in **subjects** sorted descended by `_samples_count` and for equal `_samples_count` it will sort ascending by `_aliquots_count`.

```
{
  subject {
    hits(last: 5, offset: 0, sort: [
      {
				field: "_samples_count",
				order: desc
      },
      {
        field: "_aliquots_count",
        order: asc
      }
    ]) {
      total
      edges {
        node {
          id
          _samples_count
         	_aliquots_count
          _ct_count
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Aggregations

Flat model supports two types of the aggregations: `bucket` for strings and enum values and `stats` for numerical values.

`bucket` support `key` for the actual value and `doc_count` for the number of matched items with this value.

`stats` support wider range of aggregations related to the numerical values, including `min`, `max`, `avg` and `sum`. It does has `count`, to return the total number of matched items, for which this numerical value exists.

```
{
  subject {
    aggregations {
      vital_status {
        buckets {
          key
          doc_count
        }
      }
      _samples_count {
        stats {
          min
          max
          count
          avg
          sum
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filtering

Flat model GraphQL also supports filtering with Simple Query Object Notation, which will be covered in the next section.

`filter` supported for both `aggregations` and `hits`.

The following query will result in the **subjects** whos `vital_status` is `Alive` and their statistics on `_samples_count`.

```
{
  subject {
    aggregations(filters: {
      op: "and",
      content: [
        { op: "=", content: {
          	field: "vital_status",
          	value: "Alive"
        }}
      ]
    }) {
      _samples_count {
        stats {
          min
          max
          count
          avg
					sum
        }
      }
    }
    hits(filters: {
      op: "and",
      content: [
        { op: "=", content: {
          	field: "vital_status",
          	value: "Alive"
        }}
      ]
    }) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          vital_status
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## SQON = Simple Query Object Notation

Special syntax exists for filters in this new model. The `filter` object is a JSON, with top level `op` equal to `and`.

```
{
  op: "and",
  content: [
  ]
}
```

The `content` is a list of filters, they have the same structure and can be nested. Available operations: `=` (it can also check that the value is in a list of values), `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.

The following filter will find everything with `vital_status` either `Alive` or `Unknown` and `_samples_count` greater than or equal to `2`.

```
{
  op: "and",
  content: [
    { op: "=", content: {
      field: "vital_status",
      value: ["Alive", "Unknown"]
    }},
    { op: ">=", content: {
      field: "_samples_count",
      value: 2
    }}
  ]
}
```

`filter` is fully compatible with other `hits` and `aggregations` parameters.

```
{
  subject {
    aggregations(filters: {
      op: "and",
      content: [
        { op: "=", content: {
          field: "vital_status",
          value: ["Alive", "Unknown"]
        }},
        { op: ">=", content: {
          field: "_samples_count",
          value: 2
        }}
      ]
    }) {
      _samples_count {
        stats {
          min
          max
          count
          avg
					sum
        }
      }
    }
    hits(first: 1, offset: 0, sort: [
      {
        field: "_samples_count",
        order: desc
      }
    ],
      filters: {
      op: "and",
      content: [
        { op: "=", content: {
          field: "vital_status",
          value: ["Alive", "Unknown"]
        }},
        { op: ">=", content: {
          field: "_samples_count",
          value: 2
        }}
      ]
    }) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          vital_status
          _samples_count
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

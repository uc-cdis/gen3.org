# Gen3 Flat Model GraphQL

The flat model requires new GraphQL syntax. It requires few additional keywords to use in GraphQL query as it maps to the data in Elasticsearch.

You can find queries and details on the *Guppy* query syntax on our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/uc-cdis/guppy/blob/master/doc/queries.md) and in our [User Guide](https://gen3.org/resources/user/query-data/#flat-model).

# Draft FAQ Folder

This folder contains draft FAQ documents to eventually be integrated into the gen3.org site. This is the place we can maintain an unpublished, running-list of FAQ from users, operators, developers, and sponsors. This repository is replacing and consolidating other FAQ collection docs, like those in Google Drive or Box, which should be deprecated.

* Sponsor FAQ: This is a document that lists FAQ from sponsors or potential new clients/owners of a Gen3 resource. It is primarily a MARKETING document that lists FAQ about what Gen3 can do, and should focus on selling Gen3 by listing all the cool stuff you can do with Gen3.

* User FAQ: This is a document that lists FAQ from Gen3's user base. It addresses questions like, "How can I access data files in Gen3?", "How do I know if I'm authorized for a file?", "How do I send a request to Gen3 APIs?", "How can I generate a file download manifest in the explorer?", etc.

The following two docs (dev/operator FAQ) may not be needed? But to be thorough, I've included them in case we find a need for them.

* Developer FAQ: This is a document that lists FAQ from Gen3's developer community. It addresses questions like, "How do I add functionality to Gen3?", "How can I create a dev environment to test this or that?", etc.

* Operator FAQ: This is a document that lists FAQ from Gen3 operators, or individuals/orgs that are currently running an instance of Gen3. It addresses questions like, "How do I troubleshoot this pod not coming up?", "Can I deploy Gen3 on Azure?", "How do I setup cloud buckets to restrict access to a VPC?", etc.

These FAQs should go through a thorough review, especially the sponsor FAQ, before publishing to the public gen3.org site.  It should also be periodically reviewed and updated to make sure content remains correct.

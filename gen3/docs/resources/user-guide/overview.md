# Welcome to the General Gen3 Data Commons Documentation


## Overview

The Center for Translational Data Science (CTDS) at the University of Chicago has developed and maintains [the Gen3 software stack][Gen3 site] to help accelerate scientific discovery through creation of a collaborative infrastructure that enables sharing of information between stakeholders in industry, academia, and regulatory agencies.

The Gen3 software stack is a [collection of microservices][Gen3 site] that enable the standing-up of data commons, which allows different partner organizations to pool data and grants approved researchers access to harmonized datasets in a scalable, reproducible, and secure manner.

## Guiding Principles

* OPEN DATA

We believe that data must be open and accessible within the research community to collectively achieve the critical mass of data necessary to power data-driven research, insight, and discovery.

* OPEN-SOURCE

We believe that collaboration creates a knowledge pool that not only drives better software development, but also connects us to an active community in pursuit of shared social impact. We have long benefitted from open-source software and are committed to contributing to future generations of software and scholars.

* OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE

We believe that rapid innovation is most effectively achieved through an open infrastructure environment where portability and compatibility are maximized and knowledge is distributed broadly.

## The Data Commons Architecture

User access to the Gen3 data commons runs through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Access to data and analysis tools through a VPC allows for balance of usability and security. All access is through a monitored head node. Data is not directly accessed from the Internet.

Other secure and compliant Gen3 member systems (including cloud-based systems) can access Gen3 data through the API.

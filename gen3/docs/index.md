# Gen3 Documentation

This is your home for all technical documentation related to the design, deployment, use, and maintenance of a Gen3 data commons or mesh.

Please visit [Gen3.org](https://gen3.org) if you would like a high-level overview of Gen3 as well as details about the Gen3 philosophy, community events, and governance.



Gen3 documentation is organized by the category of person interacting with Gen3:

* **Gen3 User** - This is a data scientist, researcher, or analyst who needs to explore, download, or analyze data found within an existing instance of Gen3.
* **Gen3 Developer** - This is a software engineer who wants to extend Gen3 either by contributing to the source code or by integrating Gen3 services into a larger system.  This section will cover the Gen3 architecture including the individual microservices and how they interact with each other.
* **Gen3 Operator** - This is for those organizations who operate their own Gen3 instances.  It will include content on how to Deploy or Spin up a Gen3 instance, configure a data dictionary and upload data, and customize the frontend.

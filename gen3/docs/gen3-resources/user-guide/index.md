# Gen3 User Guide

Welcome to the Gen3 User Guide.  This guide is for researchers and data scientists who are accessing a Gen3 Data Commons or mesh to locate, access, or analyze data.  Please refer to your project-specific documentation (if any) for specifics about your system.

If you are looking to attain a deeper understanding of Gen3 services in order to update or modify them please read the [Gen3 Developer Guide][Gen3 Developer Guide].  If you are looking to deploy, maintain, configure, or submit data please take a look at the [Gen3 Operator Guide][Gen3 Operator Guide].

# Gen3 Community

Welcome to the Gen3 Community! Learn from our community members and engage in technical discussions. Gen3 is an open-source product and we rely on and encourage our community of users, developers, and operators to actively participate in community activities.

## Code of Conduct

The Gen3 Community values respect and professionalism. Our purpose is to share knowledge and make everyone feel safe and included.  Please review our code of conduct [here][code of conduct].

## Community Events

About every other month, there is a virtual Gen3 Forum for the community of Gen3 developers, operators, sponsors and users of Gen3 data platforms. These events aim to share information about how to set up new Gen3 instances, build a community that can help each other, and create clear paths for support from the Gen3 core development team.

Check out the [community events page][community page] for upcoming and past events.
